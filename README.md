**NEXT, I'LL DESCRIBE HOW TO INSTALL THIS THEME THE EASY / SAFE WAY USING MACFORGE**
Which ever way you look at this, system themes for:

> * **macOS Big Sur**
> 
> * **macOS Monterey**
> 
> * and more recently: **macOS Ventura**

> > Will **always** require to have System Integrity Protection off for the purpose of changing system files and using MacForge
> >

In the case of this theme, additonal steps are required if you want to experience it like it's meant to be. 

First things first.
Boot to your Recovery Partition on your boot drive where Monterey is installed; using CMD+R after first boot or with a restart.
